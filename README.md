# REALLY IMPORTANTED WARNING
THIS IS OLD PSYCH(VERISON < 0.7)LMAO





# Friday Night Funkin' - Raincandy Engine
My own Engine for friday night funkin!!!!1 yeah kinda werid i know

This engine kinda like modding plus & psych in one engine(used psych as default)
And modding plus stuffs are mod supports lmao

## Installation:
First you must have [Haxe 4.2.5](https://haxe.org/download/), seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff dude.

Other installations you'd need is the additional libraries, a fully updated list will be in `Project.xml` in the project root, but here are the one's I'm using as of writing.

```
hscript
flixel-ui
tjson
json2object
flixel-tools
uniontypes
flixel-addons
tjson
hxjsonast
hxCodec(if you want)
linc_luajit
discord_rpc
hxcpp-debug-server
```

So for each of those type `haxelib install [library]` so shit like `haxelib install hscript`

You'll also need to install hscript-ex. Do this with

```
haxelib git hscript-ex https://github.com/ianharrigan/hscript-ex
```


## Customization:

if you wish to disable things like *Lua Scripts* or *Video Cutscenes*, you can read over to `Project.xml`

inside `Project.xml`, you will find several variables to customize Raincandy Engine to your liking

to start you off, disabling Videos should be simple, simply Delete the line `"VIDEOS_ALLOWED"` or comment it out by wrapping the line in XML-like comments, like this `<!-- YOUR_LINE_HERE -->`

same goes for *Lua Scripts*, comment out or delete the line with `LUA_ALLOWED`, this and other customization options are all available within the `Project.xml` file
